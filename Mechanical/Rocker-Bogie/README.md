# Rocker-Bogie Suspension
The Rocker-Bogie is the suspension system that enables the rover to climb aggressive obstacles. The design allows all 6 wheels to be in contact with the ground as much as possible, increasing traction.  The suspension system on a typical consumer vehicle can traverse obstacles about half the height of one wheel; the Rocker-Bogie suspension system can traverse obstacles over 2 times the height of the wheel.

## Features
  * Modular link lengths give the ability to customize rover geometry
  * Optimized for climbing in the forwards direction
  * Rigid support structure resists lateral bending/twisting about the Bogie joint
