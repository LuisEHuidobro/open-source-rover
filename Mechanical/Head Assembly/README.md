# Head Assembly
The head assembly serves as the head and face of our rover. It houses a 16x32 fully programmable 7 color LED matrix which we use as a display. The head can be used to show different faces and give your robot a personality, or even to show status and metrics about your rover (power, controller connectivity, battery level, etc)!

## Features
  * 3D printed components allows easy assembly; the housing was designed to be modular and printed separately, then fit together.
  * Fully programmable 7-color LED matrix
  * Custom PCB handles the switching the digital signal level between the Raspberry Pi and the LED matrix
