# Differential Pivot
The Differential Pivot helps to offload forces from one side of the rover to the other while climbing. The differential pivot is crucial in the rocker-bogie suspension system and is designed to help keep all 6 wheels on the ground at all times. It also allows a second attachment point for the body so that it does not free rotate about the center bar that runs through it and connects the two sides of the rocker-bogie.

## Features
  * Uses inexpensive RC turnbuckles to give multi-degree rotation about 2 separate points, allowing the geometry to be greatly simplified
