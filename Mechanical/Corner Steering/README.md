# Corner Steering
The Corner Steering system gives attachment points for corner motors that we use to steer the rover.

## Features
  * Absolute encoders track the position of corners without having to recalibrate every time the rover reboots
  * Mechanically isolates the motor from moments/loads, keeping the motor gearbox more safe
  * Custom 3D printed pieces help with calibration and provide a physical limit on corner movement
